What is a Chrome Extension?:
==========================
Extensions are small software programs that customize the browsing experience. They enable users to tailor Chrome functionality and behaviour to individual needs or preferences.

They are built on web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

Extension files are zipped into a single .crx package that the user downloads and installs. This means extensions do not depend on content from the web, unlike ordinary web apps.

Extensions are distributed through the Chrome Developer Dashboard and published to the Chrome Web Store.
You can [refer](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) this.
